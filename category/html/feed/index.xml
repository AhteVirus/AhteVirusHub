<p>HTML is the acronym of Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is a standard markup language, using which we can build web sites or several web applications. However, This language is straightforward to learn and understand the programming language. HTML can describe the structure of a webpage, as it consists of a series of elements, and such features command the browser on how to display any content.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="has-neve-link-color-color has-text-color">A simple HTML document with title, heading, and paragraph</h2>



<pre class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code">&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html>
&lt;head>
&lt;title>Page Title&lt;/title>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>

&lt;h1>My First Heading&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>My first paragraph.&lt;/p>

&lt;/body>
&lt;/html></pre>



<p>Here are some basic HTML tags that are always used. However, we will learn about these tags separately. But this code here will provide an output with title, heading, and name. To try it yourself, copy the given code and <a href="https://ahtevirus.tech/html-code-tester/">click here</a>.</p>



<h3 class="has-neve-link-color-color has-text-color">HTML Element</h3>



<p>Every HTML element is written under tags. Such tags start with a tag name between greater and smaller than signs (like: &lt;tagname&gt;) and end with a similar title by adding a backslash before the tag name (like: &lt;/tagname&gt;). However, also consider tags as the essential part of an HTML program as if the programmer opens a title and forgets to close such tag, it can pop an error and result in a blank output.</p>



<h4 class="has-neve-link-color-color has-text-color">How do browsers use tags?</h4>



<p>Any browser reads the tags and determines how to display content on the web coded in a document file. However, a browser never shows the code itself. It only takes the codes&#8217; help to determine what to display on the page. Still, if something like that happens, then there must be some <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21066660/page-shows-code-not-rendering" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">errors</a> in the code.</p>



<h5 class="has-neve-link-color-color has-text-color">Code Editor</h5>



<p>Nowadays, there are several code editors available. However, we can write the HTML code using any text editors, as what matters is the file extension, which needs to be &#8220;.html&#8221;. Steps to writing such code with Notepad:</p>



<ol><li>Open Notepad.</li><li>Write the above code.</li><li>Click on &#8216;File&#8217; on the menu.</li><li>There choose the &#8216;Save as&#8217; option.</li><li>In the file name area, write &#8220;index.html&#8221;.</li><li>In Save as type, click on the slider menu and choose &#8220;All Files (*.*)&#8221;.</li><li>Set the encoding option below to &#8220;UTF-8&#8221;.</li><li>&#8220;Save&#8221;</li><li>Now to the folder where you have saved the file.</li><li>Right-click on the file.</li><li>Choose &#8220;open with&#8221;.</li><li>And select any browser.</li></ol>



<p>That is it, and now you will be displayed with the content that you have coded. Though this much simple is the language, the central part is your creativity and how you will design your content by coding. However, there are several more things available, which we will cover one by one. And if you also want to learn about such kinds of stuff, then stay connected with the community of <a href="https://ahtevirus.tech/">AhteVirus</a></p>
