<p>Let’s start by understanding Steganography. In simple words sending a private or secret message hiding in something is known as Steganography. In this process, you can hide a file, message, image, or video into a different media and send it to the individual with whom you want to share the secret message. The word Steganography is only a combination of covered writing, which came from Greek words.</p>



<h2 class="has-neve-link-color-color has-text-color">Why is Steganography needed?</h2>



<p>As of now, everyone must have watched several spy movies. We know that every country has its secret agencies or intelligence agencies. Agents of such high profiled private agencies are spread in different countries. These agents send their confidential information, files, photos, or videos to their agencies by using Steganography’s help, as they cannot send such sensitive information directly.</p>



<h3 class="has-neve-link-color-color has-text-color">Steganography is used for several generations</h3>



<p>Steganography isn’t a new concept, as the process of Steganography is used for several generations. If we check the historical data across the world, it is found that the first-ever act of Steganography was recorded back in 440 BC. In this act, <em>Histiaeus</em> sent a message to <em>Aristagoras</em>, who was Histiaenus’s vassal, where he bald his most trusted servant and marked the message on his scalp.</p>



<p>We can get several examples of Steganography in history on how the peoples used several different ways of transferring secret messages. Back then, peoples used painting, tattoo, toys, or additional writing skills to hide the private message on it to send. We can conclude that there are several different types of steganography techniques, for example, hiding the secret message using <a href="https://ijireeice.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2-SANJAY-DABADGAONKAR-Echo-Hiding-Approach.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Echo Steganography</a>, in which we can hide the message in the sound waves.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Find the list of the type of Steganography in Wikipedia.</a></p>



<h4 class="has-neve-link-color-color has-text-color">Steganoraphy is used by both hackers and government agencies</h4>



<p>In this era of technology, Steganography has also been digitized, as using the internet, we can send data from one place to another, just in seconds. Using the technique of Steganography, hackers bind viruses and malware like backdoor, payload, keylogger, or spyware, inside any necessary files like word, docs, XML, excel, photo, or video, and send such files to their victims. Once a victim opens the file, the virus gets executed and starts to infect the system.</p>



<p>Cryptography and Steganography, combining these two features can help us a lot. Let’s take an example by creating a scenario, one of the spies of X country has gathered several pieces of information and wants to send those to his agency in the country Y, now the spy used a casual selfie and using Steganography, he bound that information in the image and send that. The intelligence agency of country X was previously suspecting the spy. As the spy sends the picture to his agency in country Y, country X’s agency traces the image, as Steganography is a common thing they tried to find whether any hidden message is there or not, and game over.&nbsp;</p>



<h5 class="has-neve-link-color-color has-text-color">How to hide files inside files?</h5>



<p>There are several ways of using Steganography. Here we will only know how to hide a text or file inside an image using the Windows Command prompt (CMD).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Follow the steps below to hide a text inside an image:</p>



<ol id="block-f6eac277-e8c7-497a-97fe-9bbddcb69c4d"><li>First, create a folder and name it. I will name that ‘Steganography’.</li><li>Put your image file in your folder in which you want to hide your message.</li><li>Above in the file paths address bar, write ‘cmd’.</li><li>Command Prompt will come on the screen, and you will be redirected to the folder path.</li><li>Write &#8211; echo “*Type your secret message here*” &gt;&gt; *image file name*, like <code>echo “Follow AhteVirus” &gt;&gt; ahtevirus.img</code></li><li>Now press ‘Enter’. Done</li><li>To read the secret message, open that ‘.img’ file in any text editor like notepad.</li><li>Scroll down, and in the end, you will find your secret message.</li></ol>



<p>Follow these steps to hide a zip file inside an image file:</p>



<ol id="block-b80c2603-db91-4781-94f2-c2d661e356f8"><li>First, create a folder and name it. I will name that ‘Steganography’.</li><li>Put your image file in your folder in which you want to hide your message.</li><li>Above in the file paths address bar, write ‘cmd’.</li><li>Command Prompt will come on the screen, and you will be redirected to the folder path.</li><li>Write &#8211; copy /b *your image file name* + *your zip file name* *new file name*, like <code>copy /b ahtevirus.img + ahtevirus.zip SecretFile.img</code></li><li>Now press ‘Enter’. Done</li><li>To extract that zip file, you need a zip extract software like <a href="https://www.win-rar.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WinRar</a>.</li><li>Extract the image file as you extract a zip file.</li></ol>



<p>As every lock has a key, to crack encoded, Steganographed files tools like StegCracker can be used.&nbsp;</p>

					<description><![CDATA[First, let us understand about homograph and what it is. A homograph is a word that looks and spells the same way but with different meanings. Let&#8217;s take a prevalent word from the dictionary, for example, &#8220;fine,&#8221; which is used as &#8216;very good,&#8217; and according to the situation, it can also be used as &#8216;a&#8230;&#160;<a href="https://ahtevirus.github.io/AhteVirusHub/2021/01/06/learn-about-homograph-and-idn-homograph/" class="" rel="bookmark">Read More &#187;<span class="screen-reader-text">Learn about Homograph and IDN Homograph</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>First, let us understand about homograph and what it is. A homograph is a word that looks and spells the same way but with different meanings. Let&#8217;s take a prevalent word from the dictionary, for example, &#8220;fine,&#8221; which is used as &#8216;very good,&#8217; and according to the situation, it can also be used as &#8216;a sum to settle any matter.&#8217;</p>



<p>Similarly, in terms of computing, using several fonts, we can create different words that look the same, but the system will reject that those words are the same. Let&#8217;s check some of the names for an example:</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://ahtevirus.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201105_205355-1024x300.jpg" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is IMG_20201105_205355-1024x300.jpg" width="437" height="128"/><figcaption>Source: AhteVirus</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Doesn&#8217;t the word looks the same?</p>



<p>But now the first word is the correct one, and the second word is not the correct one. If we focus on the second word, the first alphabet &#8216;m&#8217; is not what it looks as instead of &#8216;m&#8217;,&#8217;r&#8217; and &#8216;n&#8217; is used which if a person will not focus or have weak eyesight, then it&#8217;s impossible to figure out the difference.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://ahtevirus.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201105_205339-1024x231.jpg" alt="This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is IMG_20201105_205339-1024x231.jpg" width="657" height="148"/><figcaption>Source: AhteVirus</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Are these both the same?</p>



<p>Here also in the second word, instead of &#8220;L&#8221; the capital case of &#8220;i&#8221; has been used. Yes, the creation of these words is known as Homograph.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="has-neve-link-color-color has-text-color">How does IDN Homograph Attack work?</h2>



<p>IDN is an acronym of Internationalized Domain Name, also known as a spoofing attack. You should know about domain names, as those domain names need to be registered. For example, my registered domain name ”ahtevirus.tech”. As my domain is written in the english language, it is also possible to register domain names with different languages and ASCII values. There are several alphabets available in various languages that match with some other alphabets with varying meanings like ‘O’ in Cyrillic, Greek, Latin is not assigned as the same code.</p>



<p>This differentiation provides a significant advantage for hackers. Using such differentiation, black hat hackers create similar looking sites, use such websites for phishing attacks, and gather several data like the target’s login credentials and other sensitive information. And this method of phishing is known as the IDN Homograph attack.</p>



<h3 class="has-neve-link-color-color has-text-color">Several individuals are aware of Phishing Attacks</h3>



<p>In this era, when phishing attacks became common, most literate populations are aware of such attacks. However, an IDN Homograph attack isn’t something that everyone can recognize. As in the IDN Homograph attack, the hackers use very similarly and hard to remember domain names, with that the website also consists of SSL certification, because of which the ‘https’ assures the target that the site is trustworthy and safe. That is where the hacker succeeds.</p>



<h4 class="has-neve-link-color-color has-text-color">How to check about the site&#8217;s reality?</h4>



<p>The concept of IDN Homograph Attack is spooky, and the main question arises on how to know the reality of the website. To figure out whether the website is genuine or a fake one, always check the SSL certificate of the website, and if you find that the website is real, then only continue to input your password else you are brilliant.</p>



<h5 class="has-neve-link-color-color has-text-color">How to check the SSL certificate?</h5>



<p>To check the SSL certificate, it isn’t a significant process to check out the SSL certificate. If you are reading this tutorial on Chrome browser’s desktop version, then follow these steps:</p>



<ol id="block-85066504-3b39-477d-b263-3bda77fa6879"><li>Upside there, you can see several tabs, and below that, in the search bar, you can find the link address to this blog.</li><li>Besides that link address on the left side, there is a lock icon.</li><li>Click on the lock icon. Where you will find “Connection is secure.”</li><li>Below the secure tag, there is a button named “Certificate”.</li><li>Click on the button.</li><li>Now in the general tab, you find “Issued to”</li><li>Below that there a “Common Name (CN)” is provided.</li><li>If the site is authentic, the common name will consist of the actual domain name. Else, you will find the reality of the website.</li></ol>



<p>Now for those users who are reading this content on Chrome browser’s mobile version, follow these steps:</p>



<ol id="block-3d01fc8a-f626-4f5e-a99f-0d8b7e6a0b73"><li>At the top of the page, you will find the blog address.</li><li>Besides the address on the left side, a lock icon is available.</li><li>Tap on the lock icon, where you will see a tag “connection is secure.”</li><li>Now, tap on “Details.”</li><li>Below the domain name, you will find “Certificate information”.</li><li>Tap on the Certificate information.</li><li>Below the <a href="https://ahtevirus.tech/">ahtevirus.tech</a> tab, you will find “ISSUED TO”.</li><li>Below which, you can find Common Name (CN).</li><li>If the site is authentic, the common name will consist of the actual domain name. Else, you will find the reality of the website.</li></ol>



<h6 class="has-neve-link-color-color has-text-color">How do attackers create such links?</h6>



<p>For the creation of such links, there are several websites available on the web. For example, <a href="http://www.irongeek.com/homoglyph-attack-generator.php">Irongeek</a>, where we can use a free Homograph attack generator. Follow these steps:</p>



<ol id="block-869fd723-8d0a-4926-8af1-2b75485f0e69"><li>You will be asked to type your name.</li><li>In the field, type the domain name you want to use.</li><li>Now, you will find several alphabets related to your search.</li><li>Select those alphabets which are similar to yours.</li><li>After the selection below, you will find your Homographed name, which will look like the original name.</li><li>Click on submit.</li><li>And you will get the encoded name, which, if you register, you will be provided with the original name&#8217;s dummy.</li></ol>



<p>However, Homograph is a grave matter, as everyone will not check the sites before inputting their values. Several browser companies like Chrome and Safari have fixed the issue, and we hope that every browser will fix this security issue in the future.</p>
